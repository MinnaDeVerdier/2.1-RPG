#### Assignment for software development education: Intro to Programming and Computer Science

## To-Do

DONE Create methods for 4 different dice uting Random

DONE Initialize one player and one monster character with preset stats for attack, defense, parry, HP.

DONE Loop a fight-sequence 100 times to measure statistics

DONE Balance the stats until there is close to a 50% chance of winning

# If I have extra time I want to expand with:

DONE facing a new monster after victory 

DONE randomized stats for monsters

DONE a rudimentary program-loop

DONE a way to replenish HP with some other restriction to balance it [ DONE time-restriction ]

DONE a way to avoid fights

more customizable player character [ DONE name ]

rewards: random loot in rooms, finding better equipment after victory, "leveling up"?

choosing path

traps or conditions (bleeding, poisoned, fear)

# Alternatives to try:

making a dice-class and assing dice as objects to the players stats

restricting opportunities for rest instead of time-restriction

carry meals or snacks with different nutrition to restore hp instead of rest (can tie into poison/ if eating found food)
